# AetherGeo

AetherGeo is a modern software interface for visualizing and processing geospatial data, designed to bridge the gap between advanced remote sensing techniques and geological applications.

## Features


- **Spectral Unmixing**: Decompose mixed pixels into constituent materials to identify specific minerals.
- **Mineral Prospectivity Mapping**: Generate probability maps for potential mineral deposits using multi-source data.
- **Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction**: Apply advanced algorithms like PCA and clustering to simplify complex datasets and reveal hidden patterns.
